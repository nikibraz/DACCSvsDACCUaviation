## Overview
This repository contains the code used to analyze and support the findings of the paper "Can synthetic fuel achieve climate-neutral aviation in a cost-effective way?" The code is designed to assess the cost-effectiveness and feasibility of using synthetic fuels to achieve climate-neutral aviation.

The structure of the code is designed for ease of use. All computations and analyses are managed through the `main.py` script. By following the steps below, you will be able to run the analysis and generate the relevant figures and results for the paper.

## Prerequisites

### Software Requirements
To run the code, you will need the following software installed on your system:
- Conda (for managing the environment)
- Python 3.8 or above

### Conda Environment
The code depends on several Python packages that are listed in the `DACCSvsDACCUaviation.yml` environment file. Before running the code, ensure that you create and activate the conda environment as follows:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the repository folder in your terminal.

3. Create the conda environment using the provided YAML file:

    ```bash
    conda env create -f DACCSvsDACCUaviation.yml
    ```

4. Activate the environment:

    ```bash
    conda activate DACCSvsDACCUaviation
    ```

## Folder Structure

The code will require the following folder structure:

- `figures/`: This folder will store all the generated figures from the analysis.
- `export/`: This folder will be used to export the results and data generated by the analysis.

Make sure you create these folders before running the code:

```bash
mkdir figures export
